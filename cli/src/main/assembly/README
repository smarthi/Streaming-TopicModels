  Installation
  ----------------

** Windows 2000/XP

  1) Unzip the distribution archive, i.e. ${project.build.finalName}.zip to the directory you wish to
        install ${project.name} ${project.version}.
        These instructions assume you chose C:\Program Files.
        The subdirectory ${project.build.finalName} will be created from the archive.

  2) Add the JTM_HOME environment variable by opening up the system properties (WinKey + Pause),
        selecting the "Advanced" tab, and the "Environment Variables" button, then adding the JTM_HOME
        variable in the user variables with the value
        C:\Program Files\${project.build.finalName}.

  3) In the same dialog, add the JTM environment variable in the user variables with the value %JTM_HOME%\bin.

  4) In the same dialog, update/create the Path environment variable in the user variables and prepend the value
        %JTM% to add ${project.name} available in the command line.

  5) In the same dialog, make sure that JAVA_HOME exists in your user variables or in the system variables and it is
        set to the location of your JDK, e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\1.8.0_152 and that %JAVA_HOME%\bin is in your Path
        environment variable.

  6) Open a new command prompt (Winkey + R then type cmd) and run jtm --version to verify that it is correctly installed.

** Unix-based Operating Systems (Linux, Solaris and Mac OS X)

  1) Extract the distribution archive, i.e. ${project.build.finalName}.tar.gz to the directory you wish to
        install ${project.name} ${project.version}.
        These instructions assume you chose /usr/local.
        The subdirectory ${project.build.finalName} will be created from the archive.

  2) In a command terminal, add the JTM_HOME environment variable, e.g.
        export JTM_HOME=/usr/local/${project.build.finalName}.

  3) Add the JTM environment variable, e.g. export JTM=$JTM_HOME/bin.

  4) Add JTM environment variable to your path, e.g. export PATH=$JTM:$PATH.

  5) Make sure that JAVA_HOME is set to the location of your JDK, e.g.
        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/1.8.0_152 and that $JAVA_HOME/bin is in your PATH environment variable.

  6) Run jtm --version to verify that it is correctly installed.
